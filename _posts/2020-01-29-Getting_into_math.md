# Getting (back) into math

This post is for anyone who is considering a STEM major or wants to learn math, but lacks confidence in their mathematical abilities/skills. Although I won't teach you all you need to know about math in this post, my goal is to give you a nudge in giving math another chance, and hopefully at the very least you will no longer be intimidated by math, or at the best, you will actually enjoy math.

I loved math in gradeschool and one of my favorite things to do in all of school were these "timed tests", which consited of a 8 x 8 table of simple multiplication problems like 8 x 6, 6 x 7, 9 x 4, 7 x 8. The goal was to correctly compute these multiplications as fast as you could. My love for math dwindled around grades 9 and 10 and I did not take any math classes my final two years of high school. 

My first semester at university, I was wrongly placed in a Calculus 1 course. I did very poorly and had accepted that I was just "bad at math". I thought I would be done with math and focus instead on Biology and Chemistry. The next semester, I decided to take an intro Physics course that was purely Algebra based since I was more than unsure of my Calculus skills. I loved the subject and wanted more, but learned that if I wanted the "real deal" Physics, I needed to actually learn and master Calculus, Algebra, and Trigonometry.  

For example, I would look at a problem like

$$
Solve for y.
e^{y+x} = cos(3*x) + (-1)^x
$$

and my heartrate and anxiety would noticeably increase because I didn't know what to do with the symbols I was looking at. After meditating on the thought of my getting stressed out from symbols seemed silly and I thought that if a lot of other people could understand these symbols, why can't I? So I went to Barnes & Noble, bought an Algebra and Pre-Calculus book and A Mind for Numbers. I read each of the chapters in the Alegbra and Pre-Calculus book and immediately do the corresponding problems (this is very important as you learn and retain more from doing than just reading). In A Mind for Numbers, the author Barbara Oakley details her journey through the Army and college studying languages. After serving in the Army, she decided to persue a degree in STEM (electrical engineering). Oakley does an excellent job of showing readers that they don't have to be math prodigies in order to have a mind for math.

These books combined with hours of trying to solve problems and learn math built up confidence in my ability to learn and I decided to enroll into a Calculus course again. I ended up with A, A-, A-, B, A in my sequence of five Caculus and Linear Algebra courses. I didn't do perfect, but I was no longer intimidated by math and no longer believed that I was simply "bad at math".
